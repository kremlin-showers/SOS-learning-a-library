# SOC-learning-a-library

This repository has been made as part of my SOC project done under the mentorship of Param Shah. We have tried to implement a basic machine learning library in python from scratch (using only numpy). The following major algorithms have been implemented, with classes for each:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Fully Connected Neural Network
4. KMeans Clustering
5. KNearest Neighbours
6. Locally Weighted Regression

For each of the above algorithms, we have added some code in the respective files to demonstrate the working of the classes.

Finally we have used the neural network to train on the MNIST dataset and test on the test set. The accuracy achieved is around 90%. The jupyter notebook for the same is also included in the repository.
